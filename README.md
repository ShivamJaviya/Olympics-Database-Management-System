## Introduction

The Olympic Database project is designed to manage data related to the Olympic Games. It includes information on athletes, events, medals, and more. This project was created as part of a DBMS course to demonstrate the design and implementation of a relational database.

## ER Diagram

The ER diagram for the Olympic Database is included in this repository. It outlines the entities, attributes, and relationships used in the database.

Introduction
The Olympic Database project aims to create a comprehensive database system to manage and analyze data related to the Olympic Games. The primary goal of this project is to provide a structured and efficient way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data about athletes, events, medals, and participating countries. This project was developed as part of a Database Management Systems (DBMS) course, showcasing the principles of database design, implementation, and querying using SQL.

Key Features
Comprehensive Data Storage: The database is designed to store detailed information about athletes, events, medals, and participating countries.
Relational Structure: The database uses a relational model to efficiently organize data and maintain relationships between different entities.
SQL Implementation: SQL scripts are provided to create the database schema, populate it with data, and perform various queries.
ER Diagram: An Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram is included to illustrate the database design and relationships between entities.
Presentation: A PowerPoint presentation is included to provide an overview of the project, database design, and implementation details.
